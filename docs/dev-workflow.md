# Dev Workflow

- start working by creating an empty component with `<template></template>`
- create a new story and import that component
- start working on the component and use the storybook UI to inspect it / see changes live
- if that component has `style` variations, then create stories for them too (in the same file)
- when you're done, you should add a unit test to make sure the component is working
- if you have written helper functions, make sure those are tested as well

## Notes

- during development, its normal to get issues and bugs and get stuck on a specific problem. Trying to solve the problem on your own would be the best approach, but that sometimes might require more time, than the time we have available.
So in cases when you get stuck and cant move forward, and you tried to solve the issue for more than 30 minutes, and you still have no progress, please write in the channel for help
