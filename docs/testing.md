# Testing

In the project, we have `unit` and `e2e` tests that are inside the `/src/presentation/test` directory.

- We use `Vitest` for unit testing and snapshotting
- We use `Testing Library` for compoennt testing (Testing from User's perspective)
- We use `Vue-test-utils` (Testing from Developer's perspective)
- We use `Playwright` for e2e testing
